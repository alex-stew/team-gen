    An app made with javascript and node to help team leaders to build an online org chart of their team.
  ## Installation:
    Use 'npm install' within the CL and relevant directory, to have node modules installed. Once installed, you are now ready to use the application using 'node index.js' in the CL.
  ## Usage:
    The purpose of the application is to efficiently build a useful org chart for business leaders and teams.

  ## Test:
    Within the tests folder structure you have 4 separate tests to ensure that the applications features will work as expected. Using the command 'npm run test' in the CL will initiate the testing. This assists with test driven development for adding further to the application, or for simply seeing how the application is intended to function, as is.
